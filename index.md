## Can technology mitigate the environmental crisis? Workshop'21, 1st edition 

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and industry representatives to discuss how their works and ideas can mitigate the environmental crisis - or worsen it.

Information and communication technology has changed the fabric of our society and has altered our relation, understanding and appreciation of the world around us. New and emerging technologies aim at predicting the climate using simulations models and Artificial Intelligence, monitoring agricultural soils via drones, creating atmospheric and sonic pollution maps in cities via crowdsensing, and collecting data at the field level using IoT devices. This workshop aims to explore potential impact and applications of recent technological innovations on the environment, as well as the perspectives for the years to come.

### Topics (non-exhaustive)

We encourage the submission of research, work-in-progress and position and vision papers addressing themes related to the environment. Interdisciplinary work is of high interest. We are looking for inputs relating technologies such as blockchain cloud and edge computing, visualization Analytics, Machine Learning, Big data, Knowledge Graphs, Semantic Web and Linked Data, IoT, address topics such as environmental crisis, disaster management,	health and environment, Environmental governance, Agriculture and water, Energy, Recycling, Climate prediction, Green technology, Lifestyle and sustainability, Pollution monitoring.

*Keynote (9h):*

New technologies, when designed and implemented considering global challenges and current realities, can be of great value to provide alternatives to mitigate the climate crisis we are all facing. This keynote will present a comprehensive overview of the intersections among technology and the environment, as well as a global contextualization of current and forthcoming challenges.
